/* The enumerate Race represents the Race of a player.
 * There are 16 different races in the game.
 * The races have been implemented as an enumerate to make comparisons in player races quicker, and as the 16 races are
 * predefined there is no reason to use string.
 * I have chosen to use underscore when separating words in the race names to increase readability. */
